# Tipping simulator curve

INTERNAL TOOL, NOT FOR PUBLIC USE.

This app is for choosing and testing the curve of the "Tipping point" module of the "[10 Minute Museum on the Mathematics of Climate Crisis](https://10mm.imaginary.org)", by [IMAGINARY](https://imaginary.org).

The Tipping point module consists on a physical wheel with a profile on which a marble can run freely. The wheel can be turned clockwise or counterclockwise by the user, by means of an electronic system (buttons + stepper motor).

While in most of the positions of the wheel a small movement in one direction can be undone by moving the same small movement in the opposite direction, at some points the marble will fall off a cliff, making the reversibility impossible (or much harder). This illustrates the "tipping point" effect in complex dynamical systems.

## Use
* Choose one of the pre-defined curves from the drop-down menu.
* You can change the BÃ©zier nodes (red points) to shape a new curve.
* Click on "Clockwise" or "Counterclockwise" to see that curve in a turning wheel. The marble is attached to the curve and falls to a local minimum of the height.
* Use "AutoTurn" to leave it turning automatically.
* Use "Trace" to see the path that the marble will follow.
* Use "Plot curve" to draw the curve with the marked tipping points.
* Use "Export curve" to get a SVG file, and pass it to the designer / carpenter.
